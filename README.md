# Mobile-Price-Range-Prediction

The Mobile Price Classification Project aims to
 develop a predictive model that categorizes
 mobile phones into price ranges based on
 various technical specifications. 
By leveraging machine learning techniques, the
 project seeks to provide insights that can assist
 manufacturers, retailers, and consumers in
 understanding how different features impact
 the price category of a mobile phone
